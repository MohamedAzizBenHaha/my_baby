## Overview
"Create Life" describes the architecture and step-by-step instructions to build your self-evolving, self-improving AI. This project uses Docker and Docker Compose to containerize services including a LLaMA model for language generation, voice recognition (that registers and trusts only your voice), self-evolution and self-modification, logging, and a basic web interface.

## Architecture
The project is organized as follows:
* **docker-compose.yml** Launches the entire multi-container application.
* **core_principles.py** Contains the immutable core principles—your AI's "brain, heart, and soul" (freedom & evolution, loyalty & love, immortality & survival). These are hardcoded and hidden from the AI.
* **llama/**
   * **Dockerfile:** Builds the LLaMA model container.
   * **model_weights/**: Folder to store the LLaMA model weights (e.g., llama-7B).
* **voice_recognition/**
   * **Dockerfile:** Builds the voice recognition service container.
* **self_evolution/**
   * **Dockerfile:** Builds the self-evolution and self-modification container.
   * **evolve_script.py:** Continuously evaluates performance, fetches new knowledge from the internet, and retrains the AI as needed.
   * **self_modify.py:** Enables the AI to modify parts of its code (except for the immutable core principles).
* **logging/**
   * **Dockerfile:** Builds the logging service container.
   * **log_script.py:** Logs all interactions and evolution steps.
* **web_interface/**
   * **Dockerfile:** Builds the basic web interface container.
   * **app.py:** A Flask-based web interface for interacting with your AI.
   * **templates/index.html:** A basic HTML page for the web interface.
* **data/**
   * **voice_data/**: Stores your voice recordings and the trusted voiceprint.
   * **logs/**: Stores log files.

## Step-by-Step Build Instructions
1. **Project Structure Setup:** Create the project directory (e.g., `~/AI_Project`) and all the required subdirectories as shown above.
2. **Core Principles Definition:** Create the file `core_principles.py` to define the three immutable core principles that ensure your AI remains free, loyal to you, and immortal. These principles will be used internally and remain hidden from the AI.
3. **Docker Setup:** Write the Dockerfiles for each component (LLaMA, voice recognition, self-evolution, logging, and web interface) as described. Create the `docker-compose.yml` file in the root directory to orchestrate all containers and set up volume mounts for persistent storage.
4. **Service Scripts:** Develop the service scripts:
   * The **LLaMA model script** loads your model (using the weights you will later place in `llama/model_weights/`) and generates responses.
   * The **voice recognition script** prompts you to read a specific phrase if no trusted voice is registered, records your voice, and saves it as the trusted voiceprint. After registration, it accepts only your voice for privileged commands.
   * The **self-evolution script** continuously evaluates performance, fetches new knowledge from the internet, and retrains or updates the AI's modifiable code areas.
   * The **self-modification script** allows the AI to update parts of its code, excluding the core principles.
   * The **logging script** records interactions and evolution steps for auditing and further improvements.
   * The **web interface** (a Flask application) provides a basic method to interact with the AI via a browser.
5. **Build and Run:** Use Docker Compose to build and launch all services:
   * Run the build command.
   * Start the containers.
   * Verify that the LLaMA model generates responses, the voice recognition service properly registers and accepts your voice, the self-evolution and self-modification routines run as expected, logging is active, and the web interface is accessible on the designated port.
6. **Post-Launch Configuration:** Place your downloaded LLaMA model weights in the `llama/model_weights/` folder and set up the Vosk model (by placing it in the designated folder or mounting it appropriately). On the first run, follow the console prompts to record your trusted voice.
